Rewrite Rules
=============


Apache
======

    Just set `AllowOverride` in you Host, Apache will follow `.htaccess` rules provided in twip.

Nginx(with php-fpm)
===================

    Example:

    ---
        server {
            listen      443 ssl spdy;
            server_name m.example.net; 
            ssl on;
            ssl_certificate /path/to/cert.crt;
            ssl_certificate_key /path/to/privkey.pem;
            ssl_prefer_server_ciphers   on;
            client_max_body_size 8m;
            gzip     on;
            index    index.php;

            root     /srv/http/twitter;
            location /twip/oauth { deny all; }
            location /twip/ { try_files $uri /twip/index.php; }
            location ~ \.php$ {
                try_files $uri =404;
                include fastcgi_params;
                fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php-fpm/php-cgi.socket;
            }
        }
    ---

    Note:

    In the example, twip source is located at: `/srv/http/twitter/twip`, and twip is working at `https://m.example.net/twip`.
    If you want to change to some other directory, change `root` / `location /twip/oauth` / `location /twip/`
    Remember to protect `/twip/oauth/` from leaking info when you're adjusting rules.


lightTPD
========
    (Sorry I'm not familar with lightTPD, can't provide a working example here, text below was provided by someone other. If you want to help other lightTPD users, fire an issue at github with a full example.)


    ---
    For lightTPD users, please use the following rules:
    url.rewrite-if-not-file += ( "^/(.*)$" => "/index.php/$1" )
    (Provided by kk198)


    Just a reminder, please specify the index-file to "index.php"

    ^/twip/(.*)$ /twip/index.php

    instead of 

    ^/(.*)$. /index.php

    index-file.names   = ( "index.php", "index.html",
                           "index.htm", "default.htm" )
